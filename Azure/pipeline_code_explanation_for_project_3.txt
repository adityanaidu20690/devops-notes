Azure DevOps Pipeline Code Explanation
Let's break down the pipeline code you provided step by step:

1. Trigger Section:
yaml
Copy code
trigger:
  paths:
    include:
      - 'project-3/*'  # Only trigger the pipeline if changes are made in the project-3 folder
Purpose: The trigger section determines when the pipeline will run.
Explanation:
The paths condition is set to monitor changes in the project-3 folder (and all its contents).
If changes are made only in the project-3 folder, the pipeline will trigger and run.
The * wildcard means all files and subdirectories inside project-3 are included. So, changes to any files in project-3 (including new files or file deletions) will trigger the pipeline.
2. Pool Section:
yaml
Copy code
pool:
  vmImage: ubuntu-latest
Purpose: Defines which virtual machine image the pipeline will run on.
Explanation:
The pool section specifies that the pipeline will run on an Azure DevOps-hosted agent that uses the ubuntu-latest image.
ubuntu-latest provides a fresh Ubuntu-based VM with a set of pre-installed tools and utilities (like git, Maven, etc.).
3. Steps Section:
Step 1: Checkout Code:
yaml
Copy code
- script: |
    # Enable sparse checkout and pull only the project-3 folder
    git config core.sparseCheckout true
    echo "project-3/*" >> .git/info/sparse-checkout  
    git checkout HEAD  
  displayName: 'Sparse Checkout project-3 folder'
Purpose: This step checks out only the files from the project-3 directory and its subdirectories using sparse checkout.
Explanation:
git config core.sparseCheckout true: Enables sparse checkout in Git, which allows you to pull only a subset of the files in the repository, instead of checking out the entire repository. This is useful in a monorepo setup where you may only want to build or work on specific projects within the repo.
echo "project-3/*" >> .git/info/sparse-checkout: This command adds the project-3 folder to the .git/info/sparse-checkout file. The * means that all files and subfolders under project-3 will be included in the checkout.
git checkout HEAD: This command checks out the files that are specified in the sparse-checkout configuration (project-3/*), effectively bringing only those files into the working directory. It does this for the latest commit (HEAD).
Why this step?: The goal is to avoid checking out the entire repository, especially when working in a large monorepo. Instead, you only pull in the files relevant to project-3, saving time and reducing unnecessary resource consumption.
Step 2: Maven Build:
yaml
Copy code
- task: Maven@4 #updated the maven version from 3 to 4
  inputs:
    mavenPomFile: 'project-3/pom.xml'  # Path to pom.xml for project-3
    mavenOptions: '-Xmx3072m'  # Optional: Increase memory for the Maven build process
    javaHomeOption: 'JDKVersion'
    jdkVersionOption: '1.11'  # Java 11
    jdkArchitectureOption: 'x64'  # Architecture for JDK
    publishJUnitResults: true
    testResultsFiles: '**/surefire-reports/TEST-*.xml'  # Location for test results if available
    goals: 'package'  # Maven build goal (can be changed to 'clean install' or other goals if needed)
Purpose: This step triggers the Maven build process for the project-3 module using the pom.xml file located within the project-3 directory.

Explanation:

task: Maven@4: This defines the Maven task to be used. The version of Maven is updated from Maven@3 to Maven@4. The Maven@4 task is the most recent version and is recommended for better support and enhanced features.
mavenPomFile: 'project-3/pom.xml': This specifies the location of the pom.xml file for project-3. The pom.xml file is the configuration file for Maven, containing information about the project, its dependencies, plugins, and other build-related configurations.
mavenOptions: '-Xmx3072m': This option sets the maximum heap size for the JVM to 3072 MB (3 GB). This helps prevent OutOfMemoryError in large builds, especially when Maven needs more memory.
javaHomeOption: 'JDKVersion' and jdkVersionOption: '1.11': This configures the Maven build to use Java 11.
JDKVersion tells Maven which JDK version to use, and jdkVersionOption specifies the version (1.11 for Java 11).
Java 11 is specified here, and the build will run with this version of the JDK.
jdkArchitectureOption: 'x64': This tells the build to use the 64-bit version of the JDK.
publishJUnitResults: true: This ensures that JUnit test results, if any, are published to Azure DevOps for reporting.
testResultsFiles: '**/surefire-reports/TEST-*.xml': This defines where to find the test results generated by Maven's Surefire plugin. By default, Surefire stores test results in target/surefire-reports/. This allows Azure DevOps to gather and display test results in the pipeline.
goals: 'package': This defines the Maven goals to be executed. package is the default goal to build the project and produce the output artifact (like a JAR or WAR file). You can change this to clean install or other Maven goals depending on your requirements.
Summary of the Pipeline Flow:
Trigger: The pipeline runs only when there are changes in the project-3 folder (and its contents).
Sparse Checkout: The repository is checked out, but only the files under the project-3 folder are pulled, reducing the overhead and improving pipeline speed.
Maven Build: The Maven build is executed using Java 11 and the pom.xml file inside the project-3 folder. The build will use maven package to compile and package the project.
Why Use This Approach?
Monorepo Optimization: In a monorepo setup, it's inefficient to build everything when only one sub-project has changed. Sparse checkout allows you to focus on the relevant part of the codebase, saving time and resources.
Selective Triggers: By monitoring specific folders (project-3/*), the pipeline ensures that it only runs when necessary, avoiding unnecessary builds for unrelated changes.
Memory and Performance Optimizations: By setting mavenOptions and using a suitable JDK, the pipeline is optimized for performance and memory usage, ensuring stable and reliable builds even for larger projects.
