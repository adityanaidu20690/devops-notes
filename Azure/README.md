Explanation of the Structure:
my-project/: This is the root directory of the mono repository.

Contains multiple sub-projects like aditya-project, project-2, and project-3.
aditya-project/:

azure-pipelines.yml: Pipeline configuration specific to this project.
pom.xml: The Maven configuration file for aditya-project.
src/: The source code folder for aditya-project.
other-files/: Any other files or directories related to aditya-project (e.g., resources, configurations).
project-2/:

azure-pipelines.yml: Pipeline configuration specific to project-2.
pom.xml: The Maven configuration file for project-2.
src/: The source code folder for project-2.
other-files/: Any other files or directories related to project-2.
project-3/:

azure-pipelines.yml: Pipeline configuration specific to project-3.
pom.xml: The Maven configuration file for project-3.
src/: The source code folder for project-3.
other-files/: Any other files or directories related to project-3.
other-folders/: This folder represents any other unrelated folders in the repository that do not have a pipeline configuration. These could be auxiliary files, documentation, or other tools not related to the individual project pipelines.

Visualizing the Structure:
Here's a simple ASCII diagram to represent the structure of the repository and its contents:

│   └── other-files/          # Other files for project-3
└── other-folders/            # Other unrelated folders or files
This structure allows each project within the my-project mono repo to have its own independent build pipeline (azure-pipelines.yml) and maintain its own source code and configuration files.
